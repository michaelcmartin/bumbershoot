# Support Files for Amiga HW Programming

The include files in this directory were created by E. Th. van den Oosterkamp as part of the support material for the book [Bare-Metal Amiga Programming](https://www.edsa.uk/blog/bare-metal-amiga-programming). That example code is also MIT licensed, just like my own code, so I've included copies of the library code I use here. The full copyright and license for this third-party code is reproduced below.
