# TI-99/4A Software

This directory contains programs for use with the TI-99/4A system. The source code here is designed to be assembled with the [xdt99](https://endlos99.github.io/xdt99/) toolkit.

Build products with the `.rpk` suffix are intended for use in [MAME](https://www.mamedev.org) or the [JS99'er](https://js99er.net/) emulator. Build products with the `.ctg` suffix are for use with [TI-99/Sim](https://www.mrousseau.org/programs/ti99sim/) and require the `convert-ctg` utility that is part of that product. Build products with the `.bin` suffix should work as user cartridges in [Classic99](http://harmlesslion.com/software/classic99/).
