# MSX and Friends

This directory includes programs for the [MSX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX) series of computers. It also includes work on consoles with extremely similar hardware such as the [ColecoVision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColecoVision) and [SG-1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SG-1000), as projects for all of these platforms may readily share logic and graphics data.

Assembly language code in this directory is built with [Sjasm](https://github.com/Konamiman/Sjasm/tree/master).
