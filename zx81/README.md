# ZX81 Sample Programs

These programs should be assembled with [Sjasm](https://github.com/Konamiman/Sjasm) and usually should be linked with the **`zx81link.py`** program in this directory. If using this script for your own programs, be aware that unlike more traditional ZX81 programs, **`zx81link.py`** expects the machine code origin to be **`$4090`**.

The included Makefile handles this case as well as programs built as exceptions.
